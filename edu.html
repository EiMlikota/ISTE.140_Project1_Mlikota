                <p style="color:#ef9c24;"> RIT Croatia (Web and mobile computing)<em>- 2020 - present (Zagreb, CRO) <br>After graduating from high school I mainly focused on my professional career in yachting. But I always had the question in the back of my head "what if I went to college"?
                    That's why I decided in 2020 to apply. Choosing RIT Croatia was probably one of the best decisions I made so far in my life. I am very or grateful for everything I learned and achieved so far in the past year at RIT Croatia.
                </em></p>
                <p style="color:#ef9c24;"> BlueWater<em>- may 2016 - present (Antibes,FR)  <br>I choosed Bluewater because they had a reputation as the best yachting training academy at the time.
                    I did several courses with them, in the span of two years which included: Power boat I. and II, Yacht Master license (200BT)
                </em></p>
                <p style="color:#ef9c24;"> Apave Mare<em> - apr 2016 - dec 2020 (Zadar,CRO)  <br>Apave Mare was for me the steppingstone into the Yacht industry. I did my first courses and licenses with them (STCW-95, B-Boat license)
                </em></p>
                <p style="color:#ef9c24;"> Sub-Adventure <em>- apr 2017 - nov 2017(Zadar,CRO)  <br>I successfully finished driving courses therefore I will change my diving certificate.
                </em></p>
                <p style="color:#ef9c24;"> Franjecačka Klasična Gimnazija<em>- sep 2021 - present (Sinj,CRO)
                    <br>It's probably a funny story: I attended the school because, at the time, I want to become a priest. Eventually I finished my education there but I decided the priesthood was not the right fit for me at the time.
