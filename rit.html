    <p>I got the idea to create this video while working on the reception where I noticed that no one was maintaining or updating the slides that were playing on the TV screens on campus. Annoyed with this fact and the bad quality of the content I took initiative and decided to create this new 'WELCOME' video. I'm currently awaiting approval and I hope that everybody will be able to enjoy my work soon.</p>
